Notable features include General Sherman, the largest tree in the world by volume; Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney at 14,505 ft (4,421 m), the highest point in the contiguous United States; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite, containing high waterfalls. The Sierra is home to three national parks, twenty-six wilderness areas, ten national forests, and two national monuments. These areas include Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks; and Devils Postpile National Monument.\n\nMore than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny, granite formed deep underground. The range started to uplift less than five million years ago, and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range. The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada, which are reflected by the presence of five life zones (areas with similar plant and animal communities). Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces, creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada has played an important role in the history of California and the United States. The California Gold Rush occurred in the western foothills from 1848 through 1855.

They consisted of 25 players per team and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head, or sides, with the objective being to advance it into the opponent's goal. Rutgers won the game 6\u20134. Collegiate play continued for several years with matches played using the rules of the host school. Representatives of Yale, Columbia, Princeton and Rutgers met on October 19, 1873, to create a standard set of rules for use by all schools. Teams were set at 20 players each, and fields of 400 by 250 feet (122 m \u00d7 76 m) were specified.

Songs are longer and more complex and are associated with territory and courtship and mating, while calls tend to serve such functions as alarms or keeping members of a flock in contact. Other authorities such as Howell and Webb (1995) make the distinction based on function, so that short vocalizations, such as those of pigeons, and even non-vocal sounds, such as the drumming of woodpeckers and the \"winnowing\" of snipes' wings in display flight, are considered songs. Still others require song to have syllabic diversity and temporal regularity akin to the repetitive and transformative patterns that define music. It is generally agreed upon in birding and ornithology which sounds are songs and which are calls, and a good field guide will differentiate between the two.

Bird song is best developed in the order Passeriformes. Some groups are nearly voiceless, producing only percussive and rhythmic sounds, such as the storks, which clatter their bills. In some manakins (Pipridae), the males have evolved several mechanisms for mechanical sound production, including mechanisms for stridulation not unlike those found in some insects. The production of sounds by mechanical means as opposed to the use of the syrinx has been termed variously instrumental music by Charles Darwin, mechanical sounds and more recently sonation. The term sonate has been defined as the act of producing non-vocal sounds that are intentionally modulated communicative signals, produced using non-syringeal structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers. Song is usually delivered from prominent perches, although some species may sing when flying. In extratropical Eurasia and the Americas\n  almost all song is produced by male birds; however, in the tropics and to a greater extent the desert belts of Australia and Africa it is more typical for females to sing as much as males. These differences have been known for a long time and are generally attributed to the much less regular and seasonal climate of Australian and African arid zones requiring that birds breed at any time when conditions are favourable, although they cann", "num_urls": 6, "url_domains": ["septifix.best"], "url_obfuscation": 0, "spf_result": "pass", "dkim_result": "pass", "dmarc_result": "pass", "spam_score": 8.08, "has_attachments": 0, "html_ratio": 0.39, "label": 1}

Extend your account for free fitted trains, the brake van has several purposes, and hence jobs for the guard: Operating the brake, train supervision, and illumination & communication. Firstly, and most importantly, the guard would use the brake van's brakes to assist with keeping the train under control on downwards gradients, and whenever they could see that the locomotive's crew was attempting to slow the train. Route knowledge would allow the guard to initiate the braking before the driver. To aid in this, signalling regulations mandated that signals be left at clear until the entirety of a train (including guard's van) had passed, as the guard would immediately apply brakes upon seeing a signal at danger. Secondly, they minimized the risk of snapped broken couplings by application of handbrake wheel, which would keep otherwise-loose screw couplings taut between unfitted wagons. This helped mitigate the risk of a coupling failure from uneven accelerati\n on (\"snatching\" or jerking). This was particularly a problem as locomotives became more powerful. Because coupling failures were a fairly common occurrence when starting an unfitted train, train crews were given specific instruction upon starting a freight train that the footplate crew look back towards the brake van for a signal from the guard (by flag or lamp) that the entire train was moving and all couplings were taut, before accelerating to higher speeds. Preserved SR \"Queen Mary\" bogie brake van - most British brake vans had just four wheels and a rigid wheelbase. This one has all three side lamps visible. A later job of the guard was the provision of side lamps on brake vans. The white lamp is the tail lamp, whilst the grey lamps are the side lamps, along with the standard tail lamp (showing red to the rear and sides) required on the rear of every train. The side lamps showed a white light towards the front and a red light to the side/rear. The front-facin\n g lamps were an indication to the locomotive crew that the train was still complete, whilst the provision of extra red lights to the rear was an additional safety measure. Due to the very low chance of all three lights being out at once, it was stipulated that a freight train passing without any lamps on the rear had split and that the rear portion was potentially running away. These side lamps were used on passenger trains before the adoption of continuous brakes on such trains. A further purpose for these side lamps was altering the colour of illumination lamps. Because the red indication was provided by a removable filter, a white light c", "num_urls": 6, "url_domains": ["medicinalgardenkit.za.com"], "url_obfuscation": 0, "spf_result": "pass", "dkim_result": "pass", "dmarc_result": "pass", "spam_score": 6.73, "has_attachments": 0, "html_ratio": 0.43, "label": 1}

The question of the financial viability of single-player AAA games was raised following the closure of Visceral Games by Electronic Arts (EA) in October 2017. Visceral had been a studio that established itself on a strong narrative single-player focus with Dead Space, and had been working on a single-player, linear narrative Star Wars game at the time of the closure; EA announced following this that they would be taking the game in a different direction, specifically \"a broader experience that allows for more variety and player agency\". Many commentators felt that EA made the change as they did not have confidence that a studio with an AAA-scale budget could produce a viable single-player game based on the popular Star Wars franchise. Alongside this, as well as relatively poor sales of games in the year prior that were principally AAA single-player games (Resident Evil 7, Prey, Dishonored 2, \n and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided) against financially successful multiplayer games and those offer a games-as-a-service model (Overwatch, Destiny 2, and Star Wars Battlefront 2), were indicators to many that the single-player model for AAA was waning. Manveer Heir, who had left EA after finishing his gameplay design work for Mass Effect Andromeda, acknowledged that the culture within EA was against the development of single-player games, and with Visceral's closure, \"that the linear single-player triple-A game at EA is dead for the time being\". Bethesda on December 7, 2017, decided to collaborate with Lynda Carter to launch a Public Safety Announcement to save single-player gaming. A few years later in 2021, EA was reported to have revived interest in single-player games, following the successful launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2020. The company still planned on releasing live service games with multiplayer components, but began evaluating its IP catalog for more\n  single-player titles to revive, such as a remake of the Dead Space franchise. Around the same time, head of Xbox Game Studios Phil Spencer said that they still see a place for narrative-driven single-player games even though the financial drivers of the market tended to be live service games. Spencer said that developing such games with AAA-scale budgets can be risky, but with availability of services like cloud gaming and subscription services, they can gauge audience reaction to these games early on and reduce the risk involved", "num_urls": 6, "url_domains": ["amiclearpro.za.com"], "url_obfuscation": 0, "spf_result": "fail", "dkim_result": "pass", "dmarc_result": "pass", "spam_score": 30.02, "has_attachments": 0, "html_ratio": 0.45, "label": 1}

Together with Carlos Catania (Uncuyo University), Muris Sladic (Czech Technical University in Prague), and Emmanouil Vasilomanolakis (Technical University of Denmark), we would like to ask for your help to conduct a novel and comprehensive study on the current use of honeypots. The main motivation, shared with many of you, is to understand better how honeypots are currently used. Our research questions are: For which purposes are honeypots used? Why are honeypots used or not used? What are the user experiences of honeypots? As you are surely aware, in the last 10 years, there seems to be a sort of resurgence in the use of honeypots, most clearly marked by a growing number of new companies offering honeypot solutions. However, many questions remain unanswered on how this phenomenon may be growing again. We believe that a better understanding of the current use of honeypots, both for research and production purposes, would greatly help all of us move forward to new areas, such as all the new implementations with AI that we are currently seeing. For this reason, we are conducting a small research questionnaire called \u201cKnow your Honeypot 2024\u201d , and we are asking you to please help by participating in a two-part questionnaire. The first part is online, and this text is the invitation. Based on the answers to the first part, we plan a second part with those of you who would like to participate during a short in-person interview during the Honeynet workshop 2024. Drinks are on us. This is an anonymous and privacy-respecting academic research whose results will be shared in this group and published publicly. Your help is greatly appreciated. This is the online questionnaire link (~20mins) : https://forms.gle/JwSkZsmNzt75iEcp9 Thanks for your help, and we wish to say hi in Copenhagen if you go.

Oracle Settlement Administrator\" <donotreply@katzprivacysettlement.com>", "from_domain": "katzprivacysettlement.com>", "body_text": "Notice ID: KATL0398926118 Confirmation Code: 96N96HBrvUK4 United States District Court for the Northern District of California Katz-Lacabe et al v. Oracle America, Inc., Case No. 3:22-cv-04792-RS NOTICE OF PROPOSED CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT Our Records Indicate You May Be Entitled to a Payment from a Class Action Settlement Because Your Personal Data May Have Been Collected by Oracle America, Inc. A federal court authorized this notice. You are not being sued. This is not an advertisement. (Para la notificaci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol, visite el sitio web.) A Settlement has been proposed in class action litigation against Oracle America, Inc. (\u201cOracle\u201d). This class action alleges that Oracle improperly captured, compiled, and sold individuals\u2019 online and offline data to third parties without obtaining their consent. Oracle denies all the allegations made in the lawsuit and any wrongdoing and maintains that its practices were lawful and disclosed to individuals. Who is included in the Settlement? You are included if you are a Settlement Class Member, which is defined as \u201call natural persons residing in the United States whose personal information, or data derived from their personal information, was acquired, captured, or otherwise collected by Oracle Advertising technologies or made available for use or sale by or through ID Graph, Data Marketplace, or any other Oracle Advertising product or service from August 19, 2018 to the date of final judgment in the Action.\u201d What does the Settlement provide? Under the Settlement, Oracle will pay $115 million to establish a Settlement Fund. To submit your claim, go to: www.KatzPrivacySettlement.com/submit-claim . Class Counsel will ask the Court to award up to 25% of the Settlement Fund (i.e. up to $28.75 million) for attorneys\u2019 fees. In addition, Class Counsel will ask the Court to reimburse them out of the Settlement Fund for the expenses they reasonably incurred and will incur in litigating this case on behalf of Settlement Class Members in an amount not to exceed $225,000. Oracle has reserved the right to object or comment on Class Counsel\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in the District Court and has also agreed not to appeal any order of the District Court awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. Class Counsel will also ask the Court to approve Service Awards of up to $10,000 each for the two Class Representatives named in the complaint as an award for their service to the Settlement Class as Plaintiffs and Class Representatives ($20,000 in total) out of the Settlement Fund. Class Counsel\u2019s application for attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses, and Service Awards will be made available on the Settlement Website at www.KatzPrivacySettlement.com before the deadline for you to comment on or object to the Settlement. After deducting any Court-approved attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses and Service Awards for the Class Representatives, and the costs of the Settlement administration, the Settlement Fund will be distributed to Class Members on a pro rata basis. Oracle will also certify that, for as long as it continues to offer the products and services described in the complaint, it will: (i) not capture (a) user-generated information within referrer URLs ( i.e. , the URL of the previously-visited page) associated with a website user or (b) except for Oracle\u2019s own websites, any text entered by a user in an online web form,; and (ii) implement an audit program to reasonably review customer compliance with contractual consumer privacy obligations.
