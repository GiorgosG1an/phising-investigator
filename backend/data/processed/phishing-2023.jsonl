We wanted to make you aware that a 10th-grade Pioneer student, Adriana Davidson, has been reported as a missing person to the Washtenaw County Sheriff\u2019s Office (WCSO).\u00a0 The Sheriff\u2019s Office issued a missing person alert through their Washtenaw Alert system on Saturday night. The most up-to-date information can be found on Washtenaw County Sheriff\u2019s Office (WCSO) social media outlets, as well as in their Notifications section near the bottom of the WCSO web page. We appreciate that members of our AAPS team have been working diligently and closely with the authorities throughout this weekend in support of this situation. Should your child come to you with information they feel is relevant, the Washtenaw Sheriff's office has asked that people with information call: Washtenaw Metro Dispatch at (734)-994-2911 or the confidential tip line at (734)-973-7711. We understand that, in addition to Adriana's peer group, some students and staff who do not know Adriana personally may also be impacted by hearing this information, especially if they have situations in their own lives that make them more vulnerable right now. Social emotional support is available in our schools, and in counseling offices as needed across our AAPS campuses. As always, our AAPS team is keeping a watchful eye out for students who may be struggling or who may have information to share, and will work to connect students with an adult for additional support. I know our thoughts of care and support are with the family of Adriana at this critical time. As we learn additional public information, we will remain in close communication on this matter as appropriate.

NAS Atlantic City was decommissioned in June 1958 and transferred to the Airways Modernization Board (AMB), later taken over by the FAA. In November 1958 the then-Federal Aviation Agency, now Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), took over operations of the AMB. The lease transferred to the FAA and was sold for $55,000. Atlantic City decided to retain 84 of the 4,312 acres. The FAA expanded the former U.S. Navy land parcel to about 5,000 acres (20 km2) and established the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center research facility that eventually became the William J. Hughes Technical Center. The South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) initially leased portions of the airport from the FAA and now serves as the airport owner and operator of the facility. When the Navy departed in 1958, the 119th Fighter Squadron of the New Jersey Air National Guard relocated to Atlantic City from their former base at Newark International Airport wit\n h their F-84F Thunderstreak aircraft, establishing an Air National Guard base on the site of the former naval air station. The current 177th Fighter Wing of the New Jersey Air National Guard has been at this location ever since. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the active duty U.S. Air Force's 95th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, stationed at Dover AFB, Delaware, maintained an Operating Location and Alert Detachment of F-106 Delta Darts at Atlantic City ANGB on 24-hour alert. After the 177th Fighter Wing reequipped with the F-106 in 1973, the 177th took on the air defence alert mission. In the fall of 1983, American International Airways attempted to operate a small hub at the airport with Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners with passenger service to Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Tampa and West Palm Beach. ACY has also had US Airways jet service to Pittsburgh as well as US Airways Express turboprops to Philadelphia, Baltimore and\n  Washington, and Continental Express turboprops and regional jets", "num_urls": 6, "url_domains": ["selfsufficintbackyard.shop"], "url_obfuscation": 0, "spf_result": "pass", "dkim_result": "pass", "dmarc_result": "pass", "spam_score": 17.56, "has_attachments": 0, "html_ratio": 0.43, "label": 1}

The bones showed that the bird was a heron, first named Ardea megacephala in 1873, but moved to the night heron genus Nycticorax in 1879 after more remains were described. The specific name megacephala is Greek for \"great-headed\". Two related extinct species from the other Mascarene islands have also been identified from accounts and remains: the Mauritius night heron and the R\u00e9union night heron. The Rodrigues night heron was robust, its bill was comparatively large, stout and straight, and its legs were short and strong. It is estimated to have been 60 cm (24 in) long, and its appearance in life is uncertain. There was marked sexual dimorphism, males being larger. Little is known about its behaviour, but the contemporary accounts indicate that it ate lizards (probably the Rodrigues day gecko), was adapted to running, and although a\n ble to fly, rarely did so. Examinations of the known remains have confirmed its terrestrial adaptations; one researcher thought the species flightless but this idea hThe French traveler Francois Leguat mentioned \"bitterns\" in his 1708 memoir A New Voyage to the East Indies about his stay on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues from 1691\u201393. Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees who settled on Rodrigues after they were marooned there. Leguat's observations on the local fauna are considered some of the first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in the wild. In 1873, the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards described subfossil bird bones from Rodrigues he had received via the British ornithologist Alfred Newton.

The territory of present-day Hungary was historically a crossroad for various peoples, including Celts, Romans, Huns, Germanic tribes, Avars, South Slavs, West Slavs. The foundation of the Hungarian state was established in the late 9th century by the conquest of the Carpathian Basin by \u00c1lmos and his son \u00c1rp\u00e1d. King Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000, converting his realm to a Christian kingdom. The medieval Kingdom of Hungary was a regional power, reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century. Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, the Kingdom of Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire until the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718. Hungary came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century, later joining with the Austrian Empire to form Austria-Hungary in 1867, a major power into the early 20th century. Austria-Hungary collapsed after World W\n ar I, and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary's current borders, resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians. Following the tumultuous interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis powers in World War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. Postwar Hungary became a satellite state of the Soviet Union, leading to the establishment of the Hungarian People's Republic. Following the failed 1956 revolution, Hungary became a comparatively freer, though still repressed, member of the Eastern Bloc.

To prepare for her role as a vindictive chef in Ysabella (2007), Santos took a four-month culinary course at the Center for Asian Culinary Studies. Santos said working on the show helped \"hone her skills in these two fields\" and proved that she \"can also do something aside from acting\". She was later cast in Topel Lee's horror thriller Ouija (2007) alongside Jolina Magdangal, Iza Calzado, and Rhian Ramos. The film was met with mixed reviews; Philip Cu-Unjieng of The Philippine Star wrote, \"There is nothing earth-shaking in the treatment of the material or the performances he  elicits from the ensemble.\" Jocelyn Dimaculangan, however, noted Santos's \"restrained performance\". Her final appearance that year was in the comedy drama Sakal, Sakali, Saklolo, the sequel to Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo. The response from critics was overwhelmingly negative; the Philippine Daily Inquirer's Nestor Torre Jr. dis\n missed the film for its \"thrice-told plots and exhausted stellar performances\", while Asilo stated that it \"meanders into a list of issues that eventually clutter up its exposition and focus\". Despite poor critical reception, the film grossed ?122 million (US$2.3 million) at the box office. 2008\u20132013: Established actress Santos co-produced and starred in the independent drama Ploning (2008), which was the Philippine submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 81st Academy Awards. Jimenez-David wrote that her performance showed \"maturity and ripeness, a depth of character that hints at a life lived fully and well\", and described the film as \"moving, dazzling, and yet intimate and comforting\". Santos said she considered taking the part as a \"start of a new chapter\" in her career. The film was screened at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, Newport Beach Film Festival, and Christopher B. Smith Rafael Film Center in \n the United States. Santos's next role in 2008 was in Jun Lana's psychological horror thriller Mag-ingat Ka Sa... Kulam as a woman who questions her own sanity after a car accident leaves her with amnesia. Critic Karen Caliwara commended Santos's \"versatility\" and considered her to be the film's prime asset. In 2009, Santos worked with Agoncillo and Javier Reyes for the third time in the sitcom George and Cecil, which explored a reversal of gender", "num_urls": 5, "url_domains": ["krogersurvey.today"], "url_obfuscation": 0, "spf_result": "fail", "dkim_result": "pass", "dmarc_result": "pass", "spam_score": 14.29, "has_attachments": 0, "html_ratio": 0.4, "label": 1}
